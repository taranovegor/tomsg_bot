# Trashbox Comment Parser
This package contains a parser for extracting and formatting comments from the Trashbox.ru website. The primary functionality includes fetching comment data for specific topics and presenting it in a structured format with metadata such as the author, content, creation date, and metrics. The parser is implemented as a subclass of a base parser (`core.Parser`).
