# Habr Comment Parser
This package contains a parser for extracting and formatting comments from the Habr.com website. The primary functionality includes fetching comment data for specific articles and presenting it in a structured format with metadata such as the author, content, creation date, and metrics. The parser is implemented as a subclass of a base parser (`parser.Parser`).
