# VK Clips Parser
This package contains a parser for extracting video information from VK & OK Clips URLs. The main functionality includes supporting both short and full URLs, extracting video metadata, and providing URLs for video content and its thumbnail in a structured format. The parser is implemented as a subclass of a base parser (`core.Parser`).
